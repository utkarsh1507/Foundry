## Description

This repository contains a **well-organized collection of Foundry commands** ranging from **basic to advanced**.  
It’s designed as a **quick reference guide** to make your Foundry journey easier and more time-efficient.  

While the official [Foundry Documentation](https://getfoundry.sh/) is always the best source for in-depth learning, this repo serves as a **handy shortcut**.  
I personally find it more convenient and faster than going through docs every time, although I strongly recommend reading the official documentation for a clearer and more detailed understanding.  

⚠️ **Disclaimer:**  
This repository is intended for **learning and reference purposes** only. Always cross-check with the official docs when building production-grade applications.
